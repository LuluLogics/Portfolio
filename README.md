# Personal Portfolio Design Concept using threejs
<h4>by <em>LuluLogics</em></h4>

In this project, I wanted to show that creating a fancy design like this using #threejs is not as difficult as it looks.

This project uses Threejs in vanillaJS with WebPack. I think this could be easier to understand for those who isn't familiar with React Three Fiber yet (like myself).

# Notes
Would be really appreciated if you are willing to give me a star here on GitHub 🎉 or buy me a coffee ☕ [buymeacoffee.com/lululogics](https://buymeacoffee.com/lululogics). The money will be used to produce more content about threejs or to buy new courses.
